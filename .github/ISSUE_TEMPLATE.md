Only raise issues that are **specific to the Python version** here, please.

Do not report issues that can be reproduced with the [upstream Java
project](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber).  If your issue can be reproduced with the [online Java
demo](http://libphonenumber.appspot.com/), report your problem upstream, using their
[checklist](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#checklist-before-filing-an-issue)
and (non-GitHub) [issue tracker](http://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=192347).

In particular, anything related to the phonenumber metadata or to the API should be reported upstream rather than here.
